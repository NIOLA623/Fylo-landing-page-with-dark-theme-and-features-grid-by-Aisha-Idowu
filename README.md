## My process
-I wrote my HTML content and put them in section and Divs to make it easier to style 
-I did the styling of each section after writing the HTML.
-The Flexbox, Media quqeries and CSS grid was difficult to understand so I made research on them before writing out my code
-I did the finishings on the website, though it wasn't anywhere near perfect but i was able to leaarn a few things through the process Of writing out the codes
- I will make more research on the problems I encountered while writing the codes for better understanding.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to fully understand how Flexbox, CSS grid, and Media Quries works, also the arrangement and organization of my code to make it look neater and understandable 
I also have the problem of putting both background image and color together on my CSS, I hope i can work it out and understand it better.
